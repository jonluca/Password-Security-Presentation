#### You've been lied to

---

The average American has been conditioned to use passwords that are easy for computers to guess, but hard for humans to remember

---

Walk through average user's password selection process: 

- Pick a password: mittens (their cat's name)
- Need a capital: Mittens
- Need a special char: Mitten$
- Need a num: Mitten$1

---

Overall complexity? 8 characters. 

Time to crack on an average desktop with a modern GPU? 9 hours (salted md5)

---

* Password security is almost entirely about entropy \*

* Password length is basically the only important thing


<p style="font-size: 12px">\* Mathematical password security</p>

---

#### Is that the only attack?
---

There are some pretty bad developers out there

- Still use MD5
- Still use SHA1
- Store passwords in plaintext

--- 

---

The crazy part?

- A lot of these are public

- 16.1 Million usernames/passwords per GB (uncompressed)
